\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\input{../../disclaimer.tex}\par This is a recension meant to cover each article in the \texttt{ref} directory. First abstract is pasted then I briefly explain why I've chosen to put it in my bibliography. This is aimed at not getting drown in all those deep, difficult yet enthralling articles.\par I'll try for each of them to reply to several questions: what can I use from those for my own aims? What are new suggested projects? Does it make use of ideas I ought use for my own?
