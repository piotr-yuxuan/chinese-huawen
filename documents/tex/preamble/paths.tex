% Global paths file
%\usepackage[abspath=true]{currfile}

%\newcommand\directory{../../} % This is tricky: it's perfectly fine to define \directory command here but you still need it in your master document to reach that file ^^
    \newcommand\data{\directory/data/}
    \newcommand\java{\directory/java/}
    \newcommand\refs{\directory/refs/}
     \newcommand\tex{\directory/tex/}
\newcommand\preamble{\directory/tex/preamble/}

%% Usage
% The upper commands can be use with the following syntaxes:
%	\import{\data/}{Abc123.tex} % don't forget the path's final slash.
%	\import\data{Abc123.tex} % Note final slash aforementionned has been deleted.
%	\import{\data/}{Abc:123.tex} You can't use the previous shortcut if your filename is not simple. That's supposed to be a import package bug.
