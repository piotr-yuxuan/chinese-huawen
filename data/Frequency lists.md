Frequency lists
===============

I could take several sources and make a new big one. We can weight sources from the corpus size they come from.

It implies to use both simplified and traditional characters then deal with variants. At first sight we could think both variants may give statistics about one character, but remember some simplifed character refers to multiple traditional characters. This may be tricky. But we can use that equivalence under some restrictions and query unihan database to ensure it's possible.
